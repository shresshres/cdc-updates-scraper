# CDC COVID-19 Updates Scraper
This web scraper uses [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/) with Python to scrape all updates posted by [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/) regarding COVID-19 posted on [this page](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/whats-new-all.html)

This scraper uses scrapy,[CLD-2](https://pypi.org/project/cld2-cffi/), and [html2text](https://pypi.org/project/html2text/) as dependencies. I am also using Python3 to create a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#venv-def) to create an isoalted environment to run the scraper on.

## Steps before running scraper:
- Create a virtualenv and run it. (This is slightly different for [Windows](https://programwithus.com/learn-to-code/Pip-and-virtualenv-on-Windows/) vs [Linux/Mac](https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/basics/how-to-use-python-virtualenv))
- Run `pip install scrapy`,`pip install cld2-cffi`, and `pip install html2text` from the virtualenv to install all the dependencies
## Running the Scraper on Windows
While inside the virtualenv `cd` into the root directory that contains `powershell-script.ps1` and run `.\powershell-script.ps1 ` from powershell terminal to run the script
## Running the Scraper on Mac/Linux
While inside the virtualenv `cd` into the root directory that contains `unix-shell-script.sh` and run `bash unix-shell-script.sh` from terminal to run the script

## Accessing the data
The CDC posts are saved on `posts.json` in the format `{title,date,url,text}` for each post. The links to each update are saved on `all-cdc-links.txt` in the same directory.


## Important Notes:
- Since the addition to `posts.json` are appended on instead of overwritten, all the contents of or the whole file - `posts.json` must be deleted before each run (except the first run since `posts.json` does not exist yet during the first run). If this step is not taken `posts.json` **WILL HAVE** incorrect data
- **DO NOT** delete the file `all-cdc-links.txt` even though it is safe to delete the contents of this file
- Since the log settings has been set to `INFO` only information will be displayed during runs. If an error is encounterd and the link trying to be scraped has `downloads` or `.pdf` on it somewhere, the error message can be ignored.
- While in virtualenv run `deactivate` to stop and exit the virtual envrionment
- Source code for scraper can be found in `cdc_scrape/spiders` if starting from the root directory (directory containing this README)
